This project was a clone based on the network-manager-pptp project. Thanks to the 
authors of network-manager-pptp for their time and dedication.

This is a plugin to NetworkManager project, and will enable the capability of configure, start and stop a SSTP connection using sstp-client to connect to your remote workplace.


Attention Debian Users:
------------------------------
Debian/Ubuntu users can now use my personal PPA to download and install the network-manager-sstp and sstp-client project via launchpad. 

You can import the gpg key using the following command: 
	sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 61FF9694161CE595 

Put the following two lines into the following file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sstp-client.list 
	deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/eivnaes/network-manager-sstp/ubuntu impish main
	deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/eivnaes/network-manager-sstp/ubuntu impish main

Then use your apt-get command to get both network-manager-sstp and sstp-client.
To use SSTP connections in the NetworkManager GUI, also install network-manager-sstp-gnome this way.
